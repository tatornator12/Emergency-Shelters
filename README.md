# Emergency-Shelters

This final project for school uses the JavaScript for ArcGIS API 4.x to present the locations for current natural hazards events (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanoes, floods, and wildfires) as well as the locations of emergency shelters. The web application uses a modified version of the "Location" widget to not only geocode, but also geoprocess.
